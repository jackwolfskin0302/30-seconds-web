<p class="f-justify" itemprop="text">The round indicators next to snippet icons hint at the snippetâ€™s relative
  complexity level (green - beginner, yellow - intermediate, red - advanced). They
  help us classify snippets by taking into account things such as number of concepts, code length and abstraction level.
  These indicators should be taken with a grain of salt, as learning paths may vary from one individual to the next.
