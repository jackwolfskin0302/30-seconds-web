  for reading and
  understanding our contribution guidelines. These can be found on each individual repository, while some more general
  guidelines can be found <a href="https://github.com/30-seconds/brand-and-design/blob/master/writing-guidelines.md"

  Note, however, that contributions to 30 seconds of code might be locked temporarily due to scheduled maintenance or
  heavy load of content curation. We do this to ensure that all contributions are processed in time and that no
