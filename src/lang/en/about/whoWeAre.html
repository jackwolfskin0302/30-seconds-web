<p class="f-justify">30 seconds of code is developed, maintained and curated by <a
    href="https://github.com/Chalarangelo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelos Chalaris</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/Trinityyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isabelle Viktoria Maciohsek</a>. We
  are a developer duo based in Greece and we work on 30 seconds of code as a side project. Our love for development and
  learning is what sparkled this idea and we've put a lot of effort into making it the best resource we've never had
  when we started out as developers.</p>
